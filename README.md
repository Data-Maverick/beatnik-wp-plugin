# Beatnik Wordpress Plugin

v0.1.3

This Wordpress plugin adds a content type called "Beatnik" to the Daily Maverick Wordpress site, does some formatting for the front page when displaying a Beatnik article, and lets you do some custom stuff on the Beatnik article templates etc.

It also adds the option to use a "beatnik" folder to a normal article. (This will be moved over to Beatnik content type.)
