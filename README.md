# Beatnik Wordpress Plugin

v0.0.1

This Wordpress plugin allows editors to select projects out of the ./beatnik folder for publishing like a normal article through the Daily Maverick CMS. A Beatnik article will embed the project folder as the content of the article, thus allowing it to be promoted through the index pages but still have a completely custom interface for Beatnik, without impacting on Wordpress.
